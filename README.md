## 💡 Overview

**Rocket Boost** is a physics-driven 3D game where you pilot a rocket through challenging levels, mastering thrust control, rotation, and smooth landings.  
Built using **Unity 6**, **C#**, and the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, this project was my exploration into realistic motion, visual polish, and clean architecture.

## 🧠 Core Concepts & Systems

- 🧩 **Rigidbody Physics** for authentic movement and thrust control  
- 🎮 **Unity’s New Input System** for smooth and responsive handling  
- 🎥 **Cinemachine** cameras for dynamic rocket following  
- 🎵 **Audio systems** for engine sounds, collision feedback, and success/failure cues  
- 🌌 **Particle Effects** for thrust flames, explosions, and landing dust  
- 🎨 **Post-processing** for visual enhancement  
- 🧱 **Scene Management** for multi-level progression  
- 🧹 **Clean Code Structure**, refactoring, and debugging for maintainable scripts

## 🎮 Gameplay Summary

🛰️ The player controls a rocket using precise thrust and rotation.  
Each level challenges your control and landing accuracy with physics-based mechanics.  

🎯 **Goal:**  
Reach the landing pad safely without crashing.

💥 **Challenge:**  
Manage your fuel, rotation, and momentum — every movement counts.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through *Rocket Boost*, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Implementing **physics-based movement** and debugging motion issues  
- Structuring scripts using **clean coding principles**  
- Using **URP**, **Cinemachine**, and **Particle Systems** for next-level polish  
- Managing **game flow** using scene transitions and UI feedback  

This project taught me not just *how to make a game work*, but how to make it *feel right* and look professional.
